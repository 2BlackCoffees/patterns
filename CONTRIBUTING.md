## Summary Steps

For the following:

"Member and "Contributor" refer to the GSF member looking to make a feature contribution.
"Chair" refers to the Chair, Co-Chair or other accountable authority within GSF.

### Submitting A New Pattern For Consideration
1. Submite a new Pull Request (PR) to `GSF/green-software-patterns/dev`
2. The PR will be initially reviewed within 1 week to enforce format, structure, and relevance. The submitter must make any requested changes to advance the PR
3. The PR will be assigned a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for deeper analysis and evaluation for 2 weeks. The submitter must make any requested changes from the SME to advance the PR.
4. Once the Pattern has been approved by the SME it will begin the team review phase. The PR requires consensus before approval and merge and the Patterns team has 2 weeks to comment/object to the pattern.
5. Upon approval, the Pattern will be merged into `GSF/green-software-patterns/dev`
6. Every quarter, `GSF/green-software-patterns/dev` will be merged to `GSF/green-software-patterns/main` which will trigger a consistency review allowing anyone in the Foundation 2 weeks to comment or object. GSF-wide consensus is required for the patterns to be published.


### All Other Change Requests & Feedback
1. Submit a Public Issue using the Issue Template
2. The Issue will be looked at by a Chair and approved.
3. The Contributor is assigned an "Approved Reviewer" who will help shepherd the feature into the GSF Repository
4. Fork `GSF/green-software-patterns/dev` into a member repository, `member/green-software-patterns/dev`
5. Open a Draft PR from `member/dev` into `GSF/green-software-patterns/dev` using the PR Template
6. Once development is over, the Approved Reviewer pushes the PR into the "Ready for Review" state
7. If the Chair accepts the PR, it merges into `GSF/green-software-patterns/dev`

## Become A Subject Matter Expert
We are looking for new subject matter experts (SMEs) to help provide feedback and guidance for submitted patterns.

You can see the list of available areas in the [Suggested Tags](https://patterns.greensoftware.foundation/tags) section of the website.

## Public Issues

All contributions to the GSF are tracked through public issues. Please make a public issue and fill out details on the proposed feature contribution. The issue serves as a commitment by the contributor to developing the feature. 

The Issue is **not** a feature request, but tracks expected feature work. Please do **not** open an issue to request features.
