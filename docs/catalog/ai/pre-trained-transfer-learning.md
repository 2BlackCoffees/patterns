# Leverage pre-trained model and transfer learning for AI/ML development 

## Description
Training an AI model has a significant carbon footprint. As part of your AI/ML process, you should evaluate using a pre-trained model and use transfer learning to avoid training a new model from scratch. 


## Solution
Evaluate and select pre-trained models and use transfer learning to avoid training a new model from scratch. 

## SCI Impact
`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`

For the SCI equation, going with a pre-trained model would impact the following:
- 'E': Having a pre-trained model would reduce the energy consumption for your AI/ML training as you don’t need to train the entire model from scratch and consequently, the E number should decrease.
- 'M': Transfer learning does not require as many servers, as you don’t need to train the entire model from scratch. By reducing the total number of servers required to run a process, we reduce the total embodied carbon, the M of the equation.

## Assumptions
None 

## Considerations
None
