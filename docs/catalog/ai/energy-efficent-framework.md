# Select an energy-efficient AI/ML framework

## Description
Training an AI model have a significant carbon footprint.The underlying framework used for the development, training and deployment of AI/Model needs to be evaluated and considered for energy efficient AI/ML process.
Typically, AI/ML frameworks that is build on energy-efficient languages like C/C++ offer better energy efficiency as compared to other programming languages.


## Solution
Evaluate and select energy efficient framework/module for AI/ML development, training and inference. 

## SCI Impact
`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`

For the SCI equation, selecting an energy-efficient AI/ML would impact the following:
- 'E': Having an energy efficient framework would reduce the energy consumption for your AI/ML training and inference and consequently, the E number should decrease.

## Assumptions
None 

## Considerations
None
