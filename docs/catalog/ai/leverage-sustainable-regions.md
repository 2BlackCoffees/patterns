# Use sustainable regions for ML training 

## Description
Training an AI model has a significant carbon footprint. Leverage
a region which offers carbon-free energy for running your ML training jobs.


## Solution
Use a cloud region which has a lower carbon intensity value for running your ML training workloads.


## SCI Impact
`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`

For the SCI equation, using a lower carbon intensity region for ML training would impact the following:
- 'E': Having a lower carbon intensity region for ML training, would reduce the carbon emissions of ML applications, decreasing the E number.

## Assumptions
The migration of workloads to other regions assumes you have taken into consideration privacy, security, or data sovereignty based on your application requirements. 

## Considerations
None
