# Optimize the size of AI/ML model

## Description

Large-scale ML models require significant storage space. Big-size ML models also take more amount of resources to run as compared to an optimized model


## Solution
Optimizing the size of the AI/ML model can save on storage space, have a smaller download size and take less memory. Apply strategies like Quantization and evaluate the optimization changes against the desired accuracy.


## SCI Impact
`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`

For the SCI equation, optimization of the AI/ML would impact the following:
- 'E': Having an optimized AI model would reduce the energy consumption for your AI/ML inference, save storage space and network bandwidth and consequently, the E number should decrease.

## Assumptions
None 

## Considerations
None
