# Adopt serverless architecture for ML workload process

## Description

Building an ML model requires a series of steps, like building
a data pipeline for data capture, data cleansing, feature generation, and running multiple training iterations and experiments to get the desired accuracy. All of these steps take significant computing resources that need to be optimized for efficient utilization.


## Solution
Adopt a serverless architecture for maximum resource utilization for your entire AI/ML model development process like data pipeline, training and experiments. Serverless ensures the resources are launched only when required. 


## SCI Impact
`SCI = (E * I) + M per R`

For the SCI equation, adopting serverless architecture for AI/ML workload process would impact the following:

- 'E':  Having a serverless architecture for the AI/ML development process provides efficient resource utilization and reduces the energy consumption of the compute resources and consequently, the E number should decrease.
- 'M':  Having a serverless architecture for the AI/ML development process would lead to effective resource hardware/resource utilization as the resources would be provisioned only when required and consequently, the M number should decrease.

## Assumptions
None 

## Considerations
None
